<p align="center">
  <b>Presentations and slide shows; an open-source, clean-room reimplementation of Microsoft PowerPoint, rebuilt in pure Rust.</b>
</p>

<p align="center">
  Build decks with themes, layouts, shapes, pictures, tables, charts, transitions and animations,
  open and save PowerPoint files, and present them full screen. Native on macOS, Windows, Linux
  and FreeBSD, and in the browser. Every button is also a command that the CLI and AI agents
  (through MCP) can drive.

## What works today

OfficePresentation is in alpha, heading for beta (see the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md)).
Today it can:

- **Make decks**: slide masters and eleven layouts with placeholders that inherit position and
  formatting, eight original themes with colour and font schemes, sections, notes, comments,
  headers and footers, custom slide sizes.
- **Draw**: 150+ preset shapes with adjust handles, connectors that stay glued to shapes, freeform,
  curve and scribble tools, merge shapes (union, combine, fragment, intersect, subtract), gradient,
  picture and pattern fills, outlines with dashes and arrowheads, shadows, glow, soft edges and
  reflections.
- **Write**: in-place text editing with full font and paragraph formatting, bullets and numbering,
  columns, autofit, vertical text, fields and hyperlinks.
- **Add content**: pictures with crop and corrections, tables with styles, charts, SmartArt basics,
  audio and video (MP3, AAC, FLAC, ALAC, Ogg, Opus, WAV, AIFF; H.264, HEVC, VP9, AV1).
- **Present**: transitions (including Morph), entrance/emphasis/exit and motion-path animations,
  by-paragraph builds, full-screen slide show, presenter view, pen, rehearse timings, media playback.
- **Exchange files**: open and save PowerPoint `.pptx`, export PDF (slides, notes pages, handouts
  with selectable text), PNG/JPEG, an animated GIF of the deck and outlines. Unsaved work is kept by AutoRecover.
- **Automate**: 200+ commands with undo, all scriptable from the CLI, a JSON control channel and an
  MCP server for AI agents.

## Getting started

PDF export uses the shared `craft-pdf` writer with import features disabled. See
[`crates/pdf/README.md`](crates/pdf/README.md) for the dependency and validation requirements.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ecojust/open-office
cd open-office/vendor/office-presentation
cargo run --release -p office-presentation-cli -- render --sample --all --scale 1 out/
```

On Linux, the build also needs the ALSA headers for slide-show sound: `alsa-lib-devel` on Fedora,
`libasound2-dev` on Debian and Ubuntu, `alsa-lib` on Arch. Without them it stops at `alsa-sys`.

Fonts come from [craft-fonts](https://github.com/storytold/craft-fonts): clone it next to this repo
(`../craft-fonts`) and local builds pick it up automatically; without it OfficePresentation uses your system
fonts.

For the integrated application, use the [Open Office releases](https://github.com/ecojust/open-office/releases).

### Logs

The desktop app writes its `log` records to standard error and to `logs/office-presentation.log` in the
settings directory, beside `ui.json` and `prefs.json` (Linux `~/.config/office-presentation/logs/`, or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/office-presentation/logs/`; macOS `~/Library/Application Support/OfficePresentation/logs/`; Windows
`%APPDATA%\OfficePresentation\logs\`). A start from a desktop menu or the Dock has no terminal, so this file
is what to attach to a bug report: the crash guard's panic report, a failed crash-recovery save,
PowerPoint parts skipped on import and audio output problems land there. Each launch moves the
previous log to `presentation.1.log` (and that one to `presentation.2.log`), so the log of a run that
crashed survives the next start. The file stops growing at 16 MiB. `--version` writes no file.

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `RUST_LOG` | Log levels for standard error and the log file. Default: `info` for OfficePresentation's own crates, `warn` for everything else. env_logger-style directives replace that, e.g. `RUST_LOG=debug`, `RUST_LOG=warn,office_presentation_pptx=trace` or `RUST_LOG=info,wgpu_core=warn`; a directive ending in `*` covers every target starting with it (`presentation*=debug`). |

The logger is `apps/office-presentation/src/logging.rs`; the realtime audio callback does not log. The web
app logs to the browser console instead.

## Agents, CLI and MCP

Every action in OfficePresentation is a command with a stable id, so people, scripts and AI agents use the
same verbs:

```sh
office-presentation-cli commands format.          # list commands
office-presentation-cli run --sample --cmd 'slide.new={"layout":"titleOnly","title":"Hello"}' --save hello.presentation
office-presentation-cli mcp                       # MCP server over stdio (headless)
office-presentation-cli mcp --connect 7990        # drive the running app (presentation --control 7990)
office-presentation-cli mcp --automation-read-root DIR --automation-write-root DIR   # confine the headless agent to folders
```

## Roadmap

OfficePresentation is in **alpha**. It covers **84% of PowerPoint's features by breadth** (92% of the core
ones, measured) and is about **55% of the way to replacing PowerPoint for real work** (estimated).
See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the stage, numbers by dimension and what's next,
[docs/target-app-parity.md](docs/target-app-parity.md) for the full assessment,
[docs/gaps.md](docs/gaps.md) for every known shortfall and
[docs/parity-checklist.md](docs/parity-checklist.md) for the feature-by-feature checklist.
